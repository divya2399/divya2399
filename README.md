## Hi there! I am Divya Sharma ðŸ‘‹

You might notice things have been a little quiet here lately â€” thatâ€™s because most of my recent work has lived behind the walls of the companies Iâ€™ve worked with. From building reliable systems to improving user experiences, my hands have been full working on real-world problems (and a few production fires ðŸ”¥).

Iâ€™ve spent the past few years in DevOps and Systems Reliability Engineering, and Iâ€™m now channeling that technical foundation into Product Management â€” where I get to connect technology, users, and strategy.

So while my GitHub commits might be taking a breather, my curiosity and technical problem-solving certainly arenâ€™t.
